This harness is designed to deliver 7.4V from an RC LiPo battery (with deans connector) to the EZ-Bv4. A unique feature of this harness is that it is designed for high current applications. The power harness PCB can alternately be used with a Barrel Jack instead of wires so the EZ-Bv4 can be powered by a AC-DC power supply.
