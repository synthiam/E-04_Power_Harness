## Description

Out of our passion to solve the issue of time waste in the robot creation process, EZ-Builder was born. The EZ-Builder software platform reduces the time it takes to get from idea to implementation. Since 2011 we have been listening to the challenges robot builders encounter and continue to provide them with an ever expanding toolbox of solutions. Join us on this journey!

We didn't stop at the software, we also made time saving hardware solutions. This power harness reference design is one of them. This harness is designed to deliver 7.4V from an RC LiPo battery (with deans connector) to the EZ-Bv4. A unique feature of this harness is that it is designed for high current applications. We want to share these files with you so you can create your own version for your community and customers to enjoy!

**Features:** 
- Replaceable fuse
- Integrated ON/OFF switch
- Deans connector input, Micro deans output
- High current rated components and wire
- Flexible silicone wire
- PCB can alternately be used with a Barrel Jack
- Voltage requirement: 0-17.5VDC (7.4V Typical)
- Current rating: 6A continuous, 20A peak
- Fuse protection: 20A ATM mini blade fuse
- Wire Length: 6"
- Dimensions: 25.9(W) x 40.9(L) x 13.9(H) (mm) PCB+fuse
